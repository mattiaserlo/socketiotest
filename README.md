This is an example app to illustrate how to use SocketIO (and Node.js) to implement
a multi-client realtime communication application.

Note that you need to change these in the code, to your own server's IP number
and the port number used by your server-app:
YOUR_SERVERS_IP_NUMBER
YOUR_SERVERAPPS_PORTNUMBER
